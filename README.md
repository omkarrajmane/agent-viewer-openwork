## Features

- **Spawn agents** — Click `[+ SPAWN]` or press `N`, enter a project path and prompt. Each agent launches in its own tmux session running `claude`.
- **Kanban columns** — Agents are sorted into Running, Idle, and Completed columns based on their state.
- **Auto-discovery** — Existing tmux sessions running Claude are automatically detected and added to the board.
- **Live output** — Click `VIEW OUTPUT` to see the full terminal output with ANSI color rendering.
- **Send messages** — Type in the prompt field on any card and press `Ctrl+Enter` to send follow-up messages to an agent.
- **File uploads** — Drag and drop files onto a card or click `FILE` to send files to an agent.
- **Re-spawn** — Completed agents can be re-spawned with a new prompt from the same project directory.
- **Attach** — Click `ATTACH` to copy the `tmux attach` command for direct terminal access.
